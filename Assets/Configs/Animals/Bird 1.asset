  Name: Lena. I never meant to be alone
  Description: "I was supposed to be on vacation when it all started. Just a week
    in the mountains. No phone. No news. Just snow and silence. When I came down\u2026
    there was nothing. Roads were blocked. Gas stations were empty. I hiked for days
    before I saw the first ruins of a town. And then I knew \u2014 whatever had happened,
    it wasn\u2019t over. I stayed in a ranger\u2019s tower for months. Learned to
    grow food in buckets. Talked to myself. Named the squirrels. I told myself someone
    would come. But the truth is, I stopped believing that after the first winter.
    Then one day, I heard the drone of an engine. Not like a car. Not like anything
    I\u2019d heard in years. I climbed the tower roof and lit a signal fire \u2014
    and now I\u2019m here. In the sky again. Looking down at the places that forgot
    me. Thank you\u2026 for not forgetting. "
