  Name: "Tom\xE1\u0161. The silence saved me"
  Description: "I worked in an observatory. Far from the cities. Just me, the stars,
    and machines that hummed gently all night. I used to think the silence would
    drive me mad. But in the end, it saved my life. I saw it all through a telescope.
    Fires. Panic. Darkness spreading like a storm. I locked the gates. Turned off
    the outside lights. And waited. Weeks passed. Then months. The stars became my
    only clock. When I ran out of food, I climbed down the mountain. Everything was
    gone. People. Roads. Maps. But the stars \u2014 they were still there. Watching.
    I followed the skies, just like I used to guide ships across them. That\u2019s
    how I found your signal. That\u2019s how I found you. Now I sit in this plane
    and still can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m dreaming. But I see a constellation through
    the window \u2014 and I know I\u2019m on the right path "
