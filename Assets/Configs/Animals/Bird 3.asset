  Name: Mina. I used to dance
  Description: "Before everything collapsed, I was a dancer. Not famous \u2014 not
    even professional. But when I moved, people smiled. I danced in parks, on street
    corners, sometimes just for stray cats. When the world turned quiet, I stopped.
    Not because I couldn\u2019t. But because there was no one left to watch. I lived
    in an old theater for a long time. The stageboards creaked, but I knew every
    one. I swept the dust, lit candles, and played music from memory. My feet remembered
    even when my heart didn\u2019t. Then one day, someone left a note at the entrance.
    Just a scrap of paper: \u201CWe saw your light. We\u2019re nearby.\u201D I waited.
    Then I danced again \u2014 just once \u2014 in the open. And someone clapped.
    Now I\u2019m in your plane. My shoes are worn through. But my soul? It remembers
    rhythm. And this flight? It feels like a standing ovation. "
