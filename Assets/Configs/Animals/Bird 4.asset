  Name: Abel. I planted anyway
  Description: "I wasn\u2019t a farmer. I was a math teacher. But when the stores
    ran out and the city emptied, numbers didn\u2019t feed me. Seeds did. I found
    an old gardening book in a school library. Tore pages, made notes, learned what
    \u201Cloam\u201D meant. I started with one tomato plant in a plastic tub. Then
    potatoes. Then carrots. The world outside was grey and rotting, but my little
    rooftop garden \u2014 it was green. A rebellion in color. I watered it with melted
    snow. I defended it from birds. I whispered to it like students before a test.
    Then I heard your message \u2014 a crackling voice offering rescue. I didn\u2019t
    believe it. But I packed seeds anyway. Just in case. Now I\u2019m airborne. I
    look out the window and imagine soil again. Imagine feeding people. Teaching
    them that growth is still possible. Thank you for giving me land again \u2014
    even if it flies. "
