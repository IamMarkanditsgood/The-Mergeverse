  Name: Noor. I made music from scrap
  Description: "The first thing I lost was my violin. I left it behind during the
    evacuation. I still hear the last note it played \u2014 cut short by the alarm.
    For months I wandered, and the world was all static and sirens. I thought music
    had died. But one night, in a broken subway car, I found a tin can, a wire, and
    a glass bottle. I tightened, bent, tuned. And it sang. I made instruments from
    trash. A drum from a barrel. A harp from a gate. I played in ruined stations.
    People cried. People danced. We were still human. When your scouts found me,
    I was playing for a child who\u2019d never heard a lullaby. They said there was
    space for me on the next flight. Now I sit here, holding that can-string violin,
    listening to the engine hum. It's not Bach. But it's beautiful. And it means
    I'm alive. "
