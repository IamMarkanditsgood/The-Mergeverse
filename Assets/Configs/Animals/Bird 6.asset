  Name: Jorge. I kept the fire going
  Description: "After the outbreak, our building turned into a fortress. We boarded
    up windows, collected rainwater, and lit fires at night to keep warm \u2014 and
    to keep hope alive. I wasn\u2019t the leader. I wasn\u2019t even the brave one.
    But I became the one who stayed by the flame. I made soup out of scraps. I told
    stories I barely remembered from childhood. I kept people talking when silence
    felt too loud. One by one, people left \u2014 looking for help, or just unable
    to stay. Eventually, it was just me. And the fire. I kept lighting it. Night
    after night. Not because I believed anyone would see it. But someone did. Now
    I\u2019m on your plane, holding a charred piece of wood from that fire. A reminder:
    I was the light, even when no one watched. "
