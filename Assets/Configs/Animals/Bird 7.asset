  Name: Ilya. I only had one picture
  Description: "I lost my phone when the riots started. My home, a week later. But
    somehow, one thing survived \u2014 a printed photo. Me and my sister, grinning
    on an amusement park ride. I don\u2019t even remember who took it. I folded it
    into my jacket. I slept with it in my hand. I used it to remind myself I wasn\u2019t
    born into this wrecked world \u2014 I came from one with laughter, bad carnival
    food, and someone I loved. I searched for her. Left messages in abandoned buildings.
    Drew arrows in chalk. But I never found her. Only that smile, frozen in time.
    When your team found me, they asked what I wanted to bring. I held out the photo.
    Now I\u2019m on your plane. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in that safe city.
    But I know I\u2019m heading the only direction that still feels right. "
