  Name: Kemi. I mapped the ruins
  Description: "After the fall, I became a cartographer without a country. The old
    maps were useless \u2014 cities erased, rivers blocked, whole highways swallowed
    by forests. So I started over. I made my own. Drew each collapsed bridge, each
    passable tunnel, each place that smelled like danger. I used scraps of paper,
    charcoal, and memory. I left copies hidden in hollow trees. Marked safe wells.
    Warned of raiders. I never knew if anyone used them. But I imagined a hand, one
    day, unfolding a map I made \u2014 and choosing the safer road. When I found
    your signal, I marked it too. \u201CPossible hope,\u201D I wrote. Now I\u2019m
    flying over everything I mapped, watching it shrink beneath the clouds. I don\u2019t
    need to draw this part. You brought me beyond the edge of my world. "
