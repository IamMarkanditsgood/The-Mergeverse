  Name: Mara. I watched the skies
  Description: "Everyone else looked down \u2014 for food, for shelter, for signs
    of danger. But I always looked up. Maybe it was habit. Maybe it was denial. I
    climbed water towers. Slept on rooftops. Counted stars through broken skylights.
    The sky was the only thing that didn\u2019t fall apart. Sometimes I imagined
    the clouds talking. Sometimes I thought I saw lights \u2014 but it was always
    just my hope playing tricks. Still, I watched. Then one day, it wasn\u2019t a
    trick. A red dot, moving fast. Not a bird. Not a storm. A plane. Your plane.
    I set a flare, waved a mirror, screamed into the air. And for the first time,
    something screamed back \u2014 the engine as you turned around. Now I sit here,
    flying with the very sky I trusted. I still look up. But this time, there\u2019s
    metal beneath me. And people beside me. "
