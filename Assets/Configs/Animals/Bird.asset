  Name: Rafael. I used to fix cars
  Description: "I was a mechanic. Not a fancy one \u2014 just a guy with a garage,
    a toolbox, and enough coffee to get through another busted carburetor. People
    trusted me because I listened. And because I never overcharged them. When the
    world fell apart, cars stopped running. Roads cracked, cities collapsed. But
    engines\u2026 engines I understood. So I stayed. I kept fixing whatever I could
    \u2014 generators, radios, wheels on carts. I didn\u2019t care if it ran on gas
    or hope. One day a stranger limped into the village dragging a broken bike. I
    fixed it. He told me about you \u2014 about planes, evacuations, survival. And
    for the first time in years, I thought: maybe it\u2019s not too late for me either.
    Now I\u2019m on your plane. Looking at the bolts, the rivets, the wear in the
    metal. This thing flies because someone believed it could. And maybe that\u2019s
    all I needed too. Thanks for fixing more than just machines. "
